Aergia

![Last Commit] [![License Badge]](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

[Aergia] is a tool that implements [Infrastructure-as-Code] through [CHEF cookbook]. It helps developers and
organizations to rapidly prepare application **running environment** (on both bare-metal servers and virtual machines)
through various [CHEF recipes].

As a strong advocate of [Infrastructure-as-Code], I choose [CHEF](https://qubitpi.github.io/chef-web-docs/) to implement
this concept, because my early career at Yahoo gave me great opportunities to see how CHEF was used as a critical CI/CD
component at Yahoo's tech infrastructure. I learned that CHEF was a great tool and I would like to continue that journey
with CHEF in my own projects.

Note that although CHEF supports much more, [Aergia] automates **application environment setup ONLY** and does NOT
automate any application deployment. For example, [Aergia] offers the ability to
[install Docker Daemon](./recipes/docker.rb); but it does NOT support anything related to deploying a React app Docker
container onto that server using Dockerfile.

Community [![Discord]](https://discord.com/widget?id=1060753787125514332)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Aergia community generally hangs out [on Discord](https://discord.com/widget?id=1060753787125514332), so please drop
by if you have any questions, comments, concerns, wishes, hopes, dreams, wants, needs, yearnings, musings, or idle
curiosities about Aergia. We love meeting new people and talking with them about how they can best use Aergia to solve
their IaC problems. We know there are gaps in Aergia, and definitely lots of new, powerful capabilities to add, so
hearing about what's working and what could be better will help drive the direction of Aergia.

If you have other thoughts, or are running into trouble and are not able to get help from the community on Discord,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/QubitPi/aergia/issues) describing your problem or idea.

Usage
-----

1. **Install ChefDK**. The installation steps below works for Ubuntu OS.

   ```bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install wget
   wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/chef-workstation/21.10.640/ubuntu/20.04/chef-workstation_21.10.640-1_amd64.deb
   sudo dpkg -i chef-workstation_21.10.640-1_amd64.deb
   ```

   Other [supported platforms] include MacOS, Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS, Debian, and Amazon Linux.

2. **Run Aergia recipes in chef local mode**

   > We are running Chef client in [local mode](https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef_client/#run-in-local-mode)
   >
   > Local mode is a way to run the Chef Client against a chef-repo on a local machine as if it were running against a
   > Chef Server. Local mode relies on chef-zero, which acts as a lightweight instance of the Chef Server. chef-zero
   > reads and writes to the `chef_repo_path`, which allows all commands that normally work against the Chef Server to
   > be used against the local chef-repo.
   >
   > Basically local mode needs to know where to find all cookbooks, roles, environments, data bags, etc, and it will
   > look for them under a directory `/cookbooks`. That explains the `mkdir cookbooks` below
   >
   > References:
   >
   > - [Why can't chef resolve my cookbooks?]
   > - [Developing recipes with local mode]

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /cookbooks
   cd /cookbooks
   git clone https://github.com/QubitPi/aergia.git
   sudo chef-client -z -o 'recipe[aergia::docker]'
   ```

   The last command above runs [Docker recipe](https://qubitpi.github.io/aergia/docs/recipes/docker), which installs
   Docker Daemon on the invoking host.
   [There are much more recipes to try out](https://qubitpi.github.io/aergia/docs/category/recipes). Simply replace
   `docker` in the last command with other recipe names.

   > **Why not publishing Aergia to [Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/)?**
   >
   > - My experience with [Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/) gives me no confidence on expecting anything good
   >   from it. It's hard to use, has no good documentation, and it's buggy while not free
   > - [Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/) promises way more than [Aergia] needs. It's like when you only need
   >   a medium coffee but realize you can only get it through a combo including a double-sized burger, fries, and 12
   >   chicken nuggets.

Quick Start Using Docker
------------------------

[![Docker]](https://hub.docker.com/r/jack20191124/aergia)
[![Docker Release Workflow Status]](https://github.com/QubitPi/aergia/actions/workflows/dockerhub-release.yml)

Want to try [Aergia] but not having a playground server yet? Not worry, we offer this Docker image which allows you to
quickly play with [Aergia] in just few copy-and-paste commands:

### Step 1 - Getting Image

#### Docker Hub

You can pull the image from [my docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jack20191124/aergia/):

```bash
docker pull jack20191124/aergia
```

#### GitHub

You could also build the image from [source](https://github.com/QubitPi/aergia); this might be an useful option for
development process:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QubitPi/aergia.git
cd aergia
docker build -t jack20191124/aergia .
```

### Step 2 - Starting a Container using Pseudo-TTY

Pseudo-TTYs are used to run commands inside a container. To start a pseudo-TTY session with the container, we can use
the `-t` flag. The container will not exit until the session ends. If we want to interact with the container, we can
couple this with the `-i` flag. This will allow us to run commands in the container using our terminal. Here's an
example of the command:

```bash
docker run --name aergia -it jack20191124/aergia
```

Executing the command above will spin up the container and takes us directly into the container shell

### Step 3 - Run a Recipe

The [`chef_repo_path`](https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef_client/#run-in-local-mode) is **~/cookbooks** inside container:

```bash
root@df3r670rf23r:/# cd ~
root@df3r670rf23r:~# ls
cookbooks
```

There has already been a cookbook named "aergia":

```bash
root@df3r670rf23r:~/cookbooks# ls
aergia
```

Run a recipe using

```bash
cd /cookbooks
chef-client -z -o 'recipe[aergia::docker]'
```

The last command above [installs Docker Engine](https://qubitpi.github.io/aergia/docs/recipes/docker)

```bash
root@3tg4df12f33dsf3:/# chef-client -z -o 'recipe[aergia::docker]'
WARN: No config file found or specified on command line. Using command line options instead.
